Learn how to configure WhackerLinkFiveM for your specific server needs, including codeplugs, radio models, and server connections.

## Configuration Files Overview

WhackerLinkFiveM uses several YAML configuration files:

- **`configs/config.yml`** - Global resource settings
- **`configs/sites.yml`** - Site locations and status
- **`codeplugs/*.yml`** - Radio configurations and talk groups

## Global Configuration (config.yml)

### Audio Settings
```yaml
audio:
  beepVolumeReduction: 0.3    # Reduce UI beep volume (0.0-1.0)
  voiceTimeout: 30000         # Voice timeout in milliseconds
```

### Display Settings
```yaml
display:
  blipsEnabled: true          # Show site blips on the map
  uiTheme: "default"          # UI theme (future use)
```

### Debug Settings
```yaml
debug:
  enabled: false              # Enable debug logging
  verboseLogging: false       # Detailed console output
```

### Example Complete config.yml
```yaml
# WhackerLinkFiveM Configuration
audio:
  beepVolumeReduction: 0.3
  voiceTimeout: 30000

display:
  blipsEnabled: true
  uiTheme: "default"

debug:
  enabled: false
  verboseLogging: false

# Server-specific settings
server:
  maxPlayersPerChannel: 50    # Maximum players per radio channel
  emergencyTimeout: 300000    # Emergency timeout (5 minutes)
```

## Site Configuration (sites.yml)

Sites represent physical radio tower locations that provide coverage areas.

### Basic Site Structure
```yaml
sites:
  1:                          # Site ID
    name: "Downtown Tower"     # Display name
    siteID: 1                 # Numeric site identifier
    lat: 40.7128              # Latitude coordinate
    lng: -74.0060             # Longitude coordinate
    State: 1                  # Site status (1=Online, 0=Offline, 2=Failsoft)
```

### Multiple Sites Example
```yaml
sites:
  1:
    name: "Police HQ"
    siteID: 1
    lat: 40.7128
    lng: -74.0060
    State: 1
  
  2:
    name: "North Tower"
    siteID: 2
    lat: 40.7589
    lng: -73.9851
    State: 1
    
  3:
    name: "South Station"
    siteID: 3
    lat: 40.6892
    lng: -74.0445
    State: 2                  # Failsoft mode
```

### Site States
- **1 (Online)**: Site is fully operational
- **0 (Offline)**: Site is down, no coverage
- **2 (Failsoft)**: Limited functionality, emergency only

## Codeplug Configuration

Codeplugs define the complete radio configuration including systems, zones, channels, and talk groups.

### Basic Codeplug Structure
```yaml
# Radio hardware settings

### Radio Model Configuration
```yaml
radioWide:
  model: "APX6000"            # Default handheld model
  inCarMode: "APX4500"        # Automatically used in vehicles
  
# Models automatically switch based on player state:
# - Walking/on foot: Uses 'model' setting
# - In vehicle: Uses 'inCarMode' setting  
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Codeplugs
Create different codeplugs for different roles:

```yaml
# codeplugs/police.yml - Police-specific configuration
# codeplugs/fire.yml - Fire department configuration  
# codeplugs/civilian.yml - Civilian/basic configuration
```

Players can switch codeplugs using: `/set_codeplug <name>`

### Emergency Configuration
```yaml
# In your codeplug
emergency:
  timeout: 300000             # 5 minute emergency timeout
  autoCancel: true            # Auto-cancel after timeout
  priorityTalkgroups:         # Emergency-priority channels
    - 2001                    # Police dispatch
    - 3001                    # Fire dispatch
```

### Geographic Coverage
Configure realistic radio coverage based on player location:

```yaml
# sites.yml with coverage areas
sites:
  1:
    name: "Downtown Tower"
    siteID: 1
    lat: 40.7128
    lng: -74.0060
    State: 1
    coverage:
      radius: 5000            # Coverage radius in meters
      signal: 5               # Signal strength (1-5)
```

## Testing Your Configuration

### Validate Configuration Files
1. Start your FiveM server
2. Check console for YAML parsing errors
3. Look for successful codeplug loading messages

### In-Game Testing
1. Use `/set_codeplug <your-codeplug-name>`
2. Set your radio ID: `/set_rid 1234`
3. Open the radio interface
4. Test voice communications
5. Verify zone/channel switching
6. Test emergency functions

### Common Validation Commands
```bash
# Set up for testing
/set_rid 1001
/set_codeplug default
/toggle_radio

# Test site status changes
/site_status 1 0  # Take site offline
/site_status 1 1  # Bring site online
/site_status 1 2  # Set failsoft mode

# Test emergency
/emergency_toggle
```

## Performance Optimization

### Large Server Considerations
- Use dedicated WhackerLink server instances
- Limit concurrent voice channels  
- Configure appropriate site coverage areas
- Monitor server performance metrics

### Memory Usage
- Minimize number of active codeplugs
- Use efficient talkgroup numbering
- Regularly clean up unused configurations

:::tip Configuration Best Practices
- Test configurations in a development environment first
- Use meaningful names for zones, channels, and talk groups
- Document your talkgroup assignments
- Regularly backup your configuration files

:::warning YAML Syntax
YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. Use spaces, not tabs, and maintain consistent indentation levels. Invalid YAML will prevent the resource from loading properly.
