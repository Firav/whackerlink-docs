# Configuration

Learn how to configure WhackerLinkFiveM for your specific server needs, including codeplugs, radio models, and server connections.

## Configuration Files Overview

WhackerLinkFiveM uses several YAML configuration files:

- **`configs/config.yml`** - Global resource settings
- **`configs/sites.yml`** - Site locations and configurations
- **`codeplugs/*.yml`** - Radio configurations and talk groups

## Global Configuration (config.yml)

Theres only a couple of settings available in the main config file. Most of them are good to leave as default.

```yaml
siteBlips: true # Show site blips on map
disableAnimations: false # Disable character animations when using the radio
# Beep volume reduction factor. 0.0 is full volume, 1.0 is silent
beepVolumeReduction: 0.6 # Radio beep volume setting, recommended to keep at 0.6
```

## Site Configuration (sites.yml)

Sites represent physical radio tower locations that provide coverage areas.

### Basic Site Structure
```yaml
sites:
  - name: "Central Site" # Name of the site, must match WLS server config
    controlChannel: "772.74375" # Control channel frequency
    voiceChannels: # List of voice channel frequencies. Do not overlap with other sites
      - "771.66875"
      - "772.46875"
      - "773.74375"
      - "855.7375"

      X: 757.89

## Codeplug Configuration

Codeplugs define the complete radio configuration including systems, zones, channels, and talk groups.

### Basic Codeplug Structure
```yaml
radioWide:
  hostVersion: "R01.00.00" # Radio firmware version (visual only)
  codeplugVersion: "R01.00.00" # Codeplug version (visual only)

      - name: "Channel C"
        system: "System 1"

## Testing Your Configuration

### Validate Configuration Files
1. Start your FiveM server
2. Check console for YAML parsing errors
3. Look for successful codeplug loading messages

### In-Game Testing
1. Use `/set_codeplug <your-codeplug-name>`
2. Set your radio ID: `/set_rid 1234`
3. Open the radio interface
4. Test voice communications
5. Verify zone/channel switching
