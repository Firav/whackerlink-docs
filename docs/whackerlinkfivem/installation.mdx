# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing WhackerLinkFiveM on your FiveM server.

## Prerequisites

Before installing WhackerLinkFiveM, ensure you have:

- A FiveM server running
- WhackerLink v4 server instance (see [WhackerLink v4 Installation](/docs/whackerlink_v4/installation))
- Server administrator access
- Basic knowledge of FiveM resource management

:::warning
You must have a WhackerLink v4 server to use WhackerLinkFiveM. If you do not have a server, consider using a managed hosting service like [Smoky Ridge Solutions](https://smokyridge.solutions/) or follow the [self-host installation guide](/docs/whackerlink_v4/installation) to set up your own server.
:::

## Download WhackerLinkFiveM

### Method 1: GitHub Releases (Recommended)

1. Visit the [WhackerLinkFiveM GitHub repository](https://github.com/WhackerLink/WhackerLinkFiveM)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP** to download the source code
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP archive

### Method 2: Clone from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WhackerLink/WhackerLinkFiveM.git
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Copy Resource Files

1. Navigate to your FiveM server directory
2. Locate the `resources` folder
3. Copy the `WhackerLinkFiveM-main` folder into your `resources` directory
4. Rename the folder to `WhackerLinkFiveM`

Your directory structure should look like:
```
FiveM Server/
├── resources/
│   ├── [other resources]/
│   └── WhackerLinkFiveM/
│       ├── client/
│       ├── server/
│       ├── configs/
│       ├── codeplugs/
│       └── fxmanifest.lua
```

### 2. Configure Server Settings

Add WhackerLinkFiveM to your server configuration:

#### server.cfg
```bash
# Add to your server.cfg
ensure WhackerLinkFiveM
```

### 3. Basic Configuration

Before starting the resource, you need to configure basic settings.
Navigate to the `configs` folder inside `WhackerLinkFiveM` and open `config.yml`:

```yaml
# Radio beep volume setting, recommended to keep at 0.6
beepVolumeReduction: 0.6  # Reduce beep volume (0.0-1.0)

# Select whether to show site blips on the map or not
siteBlips: true        # Show site blips on map
```

#### Edit configs/sites.yml (optional)

The sites defined by default should cover the entire map. You can modify site names and locations as needed.
At the bottom of this file there is also a Roxwood West site that you can uncomment if you are using the Roxwood expansion.
:::note
If you uncomment the Roxwood West site, ensure you also update your WhackerLink v4 server configuration to include this site.

### 4. Set Up Codeplugs

WhackerLinkFiveM comes with an [example codeplug](https://github.com/WhackerLink/WhackerLinkFiveM/blob/main/codeplugs/codeplug.example.yml) that you can use as a starting point.
Codeplugs define radio configurations including zones, channels, and talk groups.

#### Copy codeplugs/codeplug.example.yml and rename it

Once you have copied the example file, rename it, open it and customize it to fit your server's radio setup.

#### Radio wide configuration values
```yaml
radioWide:
  hostVersion: "R01.00.00" # Radio firmware version (visual only)
  codeplugVersion: "R01.00.00" # Codeplug version (visual only)
  radioAlias: "" # Radio alias are not implemented yet
  serialNumber: "123ABC1234" # Radio serial number (visual only)
  model: "APX6000" # Radio model for handheld version
  inCarMode: "APX4500" # Radio model for in-car(mobile) version
```
#### Radio systems configuration (your WLS server)
```yaml
systems:
  - name: "System 1" # System name (visual only) -- Must match other references of the system name however.
    # This address is the Public IP of your Whackerlink Server. If hosted in a VPS, it is your Public IP of the VPS.
    # If hosted locally, this is the Public IP of your Network.
    address: "localhost" # If you're using this publically, you will need to change this to your public IP or domain name.
    authKey: "SuperSecretKey1" # Authentication key, must match the key in your WhackerLink v4 server auth_keys.yml file.
    port: 3000 # Port number, must match the port in your WhackerLink v4 server config.yml file.
    rid: null # Optional default Radio ID for this system (can be overridden in-game) -- Recommended to keep null
```
#### Codeplug zones and channels configuration
```yaml 
zones:
  - name: "Zone 1" # Display name of the zone
    channels:
      - name: "PD Dispatch" # Display name of the channel
        system: "System 1" # Must match a defined system name in the above systems section
        talkgroup: 2001 # Talkgroup ID, unique identifier for the channel. If matching in another codeplug, you can hear each other.
        scanList: List 1 # Optional scan list name, must match a defined scan list name in the scanLists section below
      - name: "PD Tactical"
        system: "System 1"
        talkgroup: 2002
        
scanLists:
  - name: List 1 # Scan list name, must match scanList references in channels above
    channels:
      - zone: Zone 1 # Must match a defined zone name in the zones section above
        channel: PD Dispatch # Must match a defined channel name in the zones section above
```

### 5. Start the Resource

1. Start your FiveM server
2. The resource should load automatically if added to `server.cfg`
3. Check the server console for any error messages

### 6. Verify Installation

#### Server Console Output
You should see:

```

#### In-Game Testing
1. Connect to your FiveM server
2. Use `/set_rid 1234` to set your radio ID
3. Use `/set_codeplug <your-codeplug-name>` to load the codeplug
4. Press the radio focus key to click on the radio interface. Turn on the radio via the radial button.
